# doas clone for linux written in rust

This is just a fun project cause I got bored one day - don't expect much support and I wouldn't reccomend using it. If you _do_ decide to use it, file issues by all means, but again: this is a hobby project, nothing more, nothing less. Keep your expectations low and use sudo or whatever unless you _really_ want to try this out.

currently there's no configuration and anyone can use this tool to get root access on your system - provided they know a user's password. I am working on a config file parser currently - but to say this is insecure currently and should not be used is an understatement. If you use this and something happens, that's on you buddy.

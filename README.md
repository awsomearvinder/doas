# doas clone for linux written in rust

This is just a fun project cause I got bored one day - don't expect much support and I wouldn't reccomend using it. If you _do_ decide to use it, file issues by all means, but again: this is a hobby project, nothing more, nothing less. Keep your expectations low and use sudo or whatever unless you _really_ want to try this out.

Currently there's no configuration and anyone can use this tool can get root access on your system - provided they know a user's password (*any* users password). I am working on a config file parser currently - but to say this is insecure currently and should not be used is an understatement. If you use this and something happens, that's on you buddy.

As of now, I haven't really used any doas code or looked at how it works, this is purely my code, meaning I'm not basing my code off of any more robust codebase's either. Look around and play with it if you want, but that's all I'm reccomending.
